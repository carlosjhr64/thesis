## Acknowledgments

> Originally I had not written this section.
> The thesis director, Clemens A. Heusch, said the thesis really should have one.
> Reading this now I'm kind of glad.
> I've fogotten the details here.

I thank my parents who were of great help to me in writting this paper.
My mom read the original drafts and after much discussion, this final version came about.
My mom taught English at the junior high level and was a Spanish major in college,
so it was a challenge to have her understand something of what I was describing in the paper.
My dad also had his input in this paper, and the diagram found in 2-2 is due to him.
My dad worked for many years as a project engineer both in Venezuela and in the United States.
He is a man of great patience.
During the time that I was at work,
my dad fed into the word processor corrections I had made to the drafts.
He also took the time to find
the daisy wheels required to print the different characters used in this paper.

The solution to the problem worked on in this paper is my own, and
I do not know if any one else has worked on this problem.
The tools I used to arrive at the solution are found in the references given in this paper.
I was first exposed to mathematical programming when
I became curious about optimum strategies for games, namely Black-Jack.
I took a Linear Programming class whichI mostly understood but still managed to fail.
My syster also struggled through a similar course at Stanford University.
She gifted me her text book,
*Introduction to Operations Research* (a book on mathematical economics!),
where the K.K.T. conditions are found.
I have skimmed over the entire book, and it is very interesting.

I want to point out that when I first proposed the problem,
I had a very vague idea of what the solution would entail.
This paper is partly due to coincidence and luck on my part.
First of all, I unknowingly proposed a problem that required a solution
with methods not normally taught to physics majors, but
to which I in my own interest had been exposed.
Secondly, since the K.K.T. conditions do not always yield a solution but merely verify a solution,
it was lucky of me to have guessed the right solution.
During the Christmas break, I had plenty of time to work on the problem, since the Boardwalk,
where I work, also takes a break.
During that time, I did most all of my work which too the form of unorganized hand written notes.
Then, after the break, life pitched me a few wild balls,
including a grade of incomplete in my last remaining class.
When it came down to typing this paper
I realized I was never going to make (it) on my old typewritter.
One minute I was crumbling up a page full of typos, the next minute I was headed toward the mall where I bought myself a Brother WP-75 word processor on credit.

Finally, I'd like to mention a few people to whom I feel gratitude and I truly: Peter Young.

After failing Quantum Mechanics 139-A,
he none-the-less smiled at me when he noticed me on the first day of class the second time around.
That time  went on to do very well in his class.
Mr. Kalar from Mount San Antonio College, the junior college from which I graduated.
After taking his lower division physics, I made physics one of my choices for a major.
I believe Mr. Kalar enjoyed making his students suffer in ways that made him a great teacher.
He warned us all not to go on to study Physics.

> I have to interject that I wish now I'd major in Computer Science instead.
> Oh well.
> Life sucks, and then you die.

He told us that there are more important things in life than physics, like one's spouse.
I understand him better now and would add that beer and pizza with one's friends
is sometime more important.
My thesis director, Clem Heusch.
Few choose Physics because it is an easy subject.
What is the point of studying physics if it is not fun?
He asked us this once while motivating us to write a thesis.
In the senior thesis seminar he reminded us that we are here at U.C.S.C because we want to be here.
We are doing what we chose to do.
He warned me that the problem I had proposed for my thesis was too hard, and
tried to discourage me from pursuing it.
But there is no freedom without the right to fail utterly and pathetically.
Clem himself noted that most people failto achieve their goals, but
that there is a lesson to be learned in such failures.
He gave as an example that an experimenter might fail to observe
some theoretically proposed particle.
He is one of the nicest professors I have ever met.

> Oh, God! Somebody stop me, please!

Lastly, I'd like to thank all of my frieds.
I do not know how anyone can go through college without a network of moral support.

> Yea, I did have my fun at U.C.S.C.
> At least, that.
