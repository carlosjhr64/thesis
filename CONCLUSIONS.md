## 8. Conclusions and Afterthoughts

An experiment determining the energy of a single harmonic oscillator is analogous to a counting experiment.
In a counting experiment, one counts the events that occur within an interval of time.
The result of such experiments are a set of number, `n`, which fit a Poisson distribution.
The count is due to random events occurring at a definite rate.
Likewise, in measuring the energy of an oscillator,
one measures the energy of the eigen-state the particle's state collapses to.
Several such measurements on identically prepared states is a set of energies,
~~En~~ `Eₙ`, which fit a Poisson distribution.
The measured energy is due to a random choice of ~~En~~ `Eₙ` with a definite expectation of `Eᵒ`.

But why should an oscillator choose to distribute its energy eigenstates with a Poisson distribution?
I don't know.
The hint to the mechanism for this distribution might be found in section 6 of this paper.
A real oscillator is "noisy."
The cause of the noise is heat.
Neighboring energy eigen-states may resonate to the dominant energy eigen-state.
This presumes some kind of coupling between eigen-states, which is not strictly true.
But a real mass on a spring is composed of many particles;
and when it comes to energy distributions,
a large number of single eigen-state particles is equivalent to
a large number of eigen-states in a single superposition state of a particle.
Thus, the coupling between the states is derived from the interaction of the particles.
If the preceding is true, then does the measure of uncertainty depend on temperature?
I feel that the mechanism for the distribution of eigen-states is a whole new problem.

To conclude, the uncertainties for an oscillator with a Poisson distribution of energy eigen-states are

~~d²[x] = h/(2πmω)~~

~~d²[p] = hωm/2~~

~~d²[Eᵒ] = [½Eᵒhω/π]^½~~

    d²[x] = h/(4πmω)       # 8.1a
    d²[p] = hωm/(4π)       # 8.1b
    d²[Eᵒ] ≈ [½Eᵒhω/π]^½   # 8.1c

all of which are small when compared to large Eᵒ.
Furthermore, the motion of the oscillator predicted by Quantum theory is the same as in Classical theory:

~~`<x>` = (2Eᵒ/(ω²m))^½ sin[ωt]~~

    <x> ≈ (2Eᵒ/(ω²m))^½ sin[ωt]   # 8.2

> And I have penciled in "from E≈nωh/(2π)".
> On my draft I have penciled in some corrections for this section.
> I'm sure the corrections are in the UCSC copy.

Therefore, the quantum simple harmonic oscillator of macroscopic average energy
passes this corresponce principle test.
