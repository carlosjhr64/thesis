> A friend of mine showed me this interesting problem:
```
x^x^x... = 2 ⇒ x=√2
```
> Looks impossible to solve, but here it is:
```
F[x]=x^(F[x]),F[x]=2 ⇒ x=√2 # Prove this
F[x]=x^(F[x])               # Given
2=x^(2)                     # F[x]=2 was given, so substitute that in
x²=2                        # Solve for x
x=√2
```
