##<a name="1Pu"></a> Optimization problem
The [Optimization problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_problem)
to be solved:

    Minimize:   ΔxΔp
    Subject to: ⧼Ψₒ|𝐇|Ψₒ⧽ = Eₒ

This will be for the quantum mechanical simple harmonic oscillator
with energy [Eₒ](SCRATCH.md#k5Y),
state function [Ψₒ](SCRATCH.md#lHR),
Hamiltonian(energy) operator [𝐇](SCRATCH.md#bdY),
position operator [𝐱](SCRATCH.md#0bH), and
momentum operator [𝐩](SCRATCH.md#w6M).
I will show that the product of the variance of position [Δ²x](SCRATCH.md#oY8)
and momentum [Δ²p](SCRATCH.md#k94) is the minimum when the state Ψₒ
is composed of a Poisson distribution [𝑃ₙ](SCRATCH.md#o0H) of energy states, and
that the minimum is that set by the uncertainty principle
due to the commutator relationship between 𝐱 and 𝐩, [&#91;𝐱,𝐩&#93;](SCRATCH.md#bST).

> TODO: section on quantum number n.

Noting that [Eₙ](SCRATCH.md#2Xh) goes as the quantum number n, and
using the definitions of Δx and Δp, I then have:

    Minimize:   √ (⧼x²⧽-⧼x⧽²)(⧼p²⧽-⧼p⧽²)
    Subject to: ⧼n⧽ = ñ

where [ñ](SCRATCH.md#Ojo) is the average quantum number.

It would not be to hard to argue (TODO: demonstrate this) that
by symmetry (⧼x²⧽-⧼x⧽²)=(⧼p²⧽-⧼p⧽²) and also that I can set ⧼x⧽=0.
Then the problem is:

    Minimize:   ⧼x²⧽
    Subject to: ⧼n⧽=ñ, ⧼x⧽=0, ⧼x²⧽=⧼p²⧽-⧼p⧽²

I suspect the extra conditions might be satisfied "for free".
Let's see how that goes:

    Min: ⧼x²⧽
    Sub: ⧼n⧽ = ñ   # Ignoring the rest of the constraints for now.

##<a name="ij2"></a> ℒ
[Lagrange multiplier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_multiplier):

    ℒ = ⧼x²⧽ + λ(⧼n⧽-ñ)

    𝒟ₓℒ = 𝒟ₓ⧼x²⧽ + λ𝒟ₓ⧼n⧽ - λ𝒟ₓñ
    𝒟ₓℒ = 𝒟ₓ⧼x²⧽ + λ𝒟ₓ⧼n⧽   # ñ is just a constant and goes away.

𝒟ₓ is the derivative with respect to x.
I will also use [𝒟](SCRATCH.md#8P4)
as the derivative with respect to [ξ](SCRATCH.md#Pvg),
the non-dimensional displacement.

##<a name="Jbc"></a> 𝒟 ⧼n⧽=0
Consider ⧼n⧽.
Just want to prove ⧼n⧽ really is a simple constant.

    𝒟ₓ⧼n⧽
    𝒟 ⧼n⧽                   # Change of variable, ξ.
    𝒟 ⧼Ψₒ|ₙ⧽⧼ₙ|n|ₘ⧽⧼ₘ|Ψₒ⧽   # Expanding out ⧼n⧽.

I will use [⨋](SCRATCH.md#AXS) to denote an an integral over ξ of a sum over n and m.

    𝒟 ⧼Ψₒ|ₙ⧽⧼ₙ|n|ₘ⧽⧼ₘ|Ψₒ⧽       # Continue from above.
    𝒟 ⨋ (𝑝ₙΨₙ)*n𝑝ₘΨₘ            # ⨋ is an integral over ξ of a sum over n and m!
    𝒟 ⨋ (𝑝Ψ*)n𝑝ₘΨₘ              # Context ₙ for brevity.
    𝒟 ⨋ 𝑝*Ψn𝑝ₘΨₘ                # There is nothing to conjugate in Ψₙ.
    𝒟 ⨋ n𝑝*𝑝ₘΨΨₘ                # Rearrangement.
    𝒟 ⨋ n𝒫ΨΨₘ                   # 𝒫ₙₘ=𝑝*𝑝ₘ, context n and m.
    ⨋ n𝒫𝒟[ΨΨₘ]                  # 𝒟 only acts on Ψ.
    ⨋ n𝒫(𝒟[Ψ]Ψₘ + Ψ𝒟[Ψₘ])       # Product rule.
    ⨋{n𝒫𝒟[Ψ]Ψₘ} + ⨋{n𝒫Ψ𝒟[Ψₘ]}   # Separate sums.

Note that although [𝒫](SCRATCH.md#IRG) is [ℝ](SCRATCH.md#yfS),
[𝑝](SCRATCH.md#2on) might be [ℂ](SCRATCH.md#Ama).
See the derivation of [𝒟 Ψ](SCRATCH.md#W3A).
Then proceed:

    ⨋{n𝒫𝒟[Ψ]Ψₘ} + ⨋{n𝒫Ψ𝒟[Ψₘ]}                               # Continue from above.
    ⨋{n𝒫(√½(√ŉ↧Ψ↓-√n↥Ψ↑))Ψₘ} + ⨋{n𝒫Ψ(√½(√ʼm↧Ψₘ↓-√m↥Ψₘ↑))}   # Subtitution of 𝒟 Ψ.
    √½(⨋{n𝒫(√ŉ↧Ψ↓-√n↥Ψ↑)Ψₘ} + ⨋{n𝒫Ψ(√ʼm↧Ψₘ↓-√m↥Ψₘ↑)})       # Take out √½.

That 𝒟 ⧼n⧽ vanishes should not be a property of 𝑝 (in 𝒫).
I proceed as if I don't know what 𝑝 is:

    √½(⨋{n𝒫(√ŉ↧Ψ↓-√n↥Ψ↑)Ψₘ} + ⨋{n𝒫Ψ(√ʼm↧Ψₘ↓-√m↥Ψₘ↑)})       # Continue from above.
    √½(⨋{n𝒫(√ŉ↧Ψ↓Ψₘ-√n↥Ψ↑Ψₘ)} + ⨋{n𝒫(√ʼm↧ΨΨₘ↓-√m↥ΨΨₘ↑)})    # Distribute Ψ.
    √½(⨋{n𝒫√ŉ↧Ψ↓Ψₘ-n𝒫√n↥Ψ↑Ψₘ} + ⨋{n𝒫√ʼm↧ΨΨₘ↓-n𝒫√m↥ΨΨₘ↑})    # Distribute n𝒫.
    √½(⨋{n√ŉ↧𝒫Ψ↓Ψₘ-n√n↥𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ} + ⨋{n√ʼm↧𝒫ΨΨₘ↓-n√m↥𝒫ΨΨₘ↑})    # Rearrangement.
    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫Ψ↓Ψₘ-n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓-n√[m+1]𝒫ΨΨₘ↑})   # Evaluate "factorals".

There are positive and negative terms very much like eachother.
Going to match them up.
I will be using [𝛿](SCRATCH.md#VuP) as the Dirac delta function:

    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫Ψ↓Ψₘ-n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓-n√[m+1]𝒫ΨΨₘ↑})       # Continue from above.
    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫Ψ↓Ψₘ}-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓}-⨋{n√[m+1]𝒫ΨΨₘ↑}) # Separate sums.
    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫Ψ↓Ψₘ}-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓}-⨋{n√m𝒫↓ΨΨₘ})     # ↓ m, 4th ⨋.
    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫Ψ↓Ψₘ}-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓}-⨋{n√n𝒫↓𝛿})       # ⟂ΨΨ=𝛿, 4th ⨋.
    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫↓Ψ↓Ψₘ↓}-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓}-⨋{n√n𝒫↓𝛿})     # ↓ m, 1st ⨋.
    √½(⨋{n√n𝒫↓𝛿}-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓}-⨋{n√n𝒫↓𝛿})         # ⟂ΨΨ=𝛿, 1st ⨋.
    √½(-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√m𝒫ΨΨₘ↓})                            # Cancellation.
    √½(-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√[m+1]𝒫↑ΨΨₘ})                        # ↑ m, 2nd ⨋.
    √½(-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫Ψ↑Ψₘ}+⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫↑𝛿})                          # ⟂ΨΨ=𝛿, 2nd ⨋.
    √½(-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫↑Ψ↑Ψₘ↑}+⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫↑𝛿})                        # ↑ m, 1st ⨋.
    √½(-⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫↑𝛿}+⨋{n√[n+1]𝒫↑𝛿})                            # ⟂ΨΨ=𝛿, 1st ⨋.
    0                                                           # Cancellation.

I should point out that these are sums over Integers,
not just natural numbers.
But there are no negative quantum numbers for the harmonic oscillator.
That is, for quantum numbers less than 0, the states are zero!
So there are no dangling terms with [∑u↑](SCRATCH.md#Uf9) or [∑u↓](SCRATCH.md#blg).
