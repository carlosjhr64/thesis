## INTRODUCTION

In this paper, I work on "the problem" of minimizing the uncertainty in both
the position and momentum of a quantum particle of large average energy in
a simple harmonic potential.

Just as Classical Mechanics can be built on Newton's laws,
Quantum Mechanics can be developed through the Schrodinger equation.
Solution to Newton's equations give the position of a paricle at a given time(x[t]), while
solutions to the Schrodinger equation give the probability of
a particle being at a given position at a give time(P[x,t]).
In both cases solutions to these equations may be difficult, if they can be found at all.
However, for the simple harmonic oscillator these solutions are well know and are relatively simple.

Solutions to the Schrodinger equation are called energy eigen-states, since
they are solutions of an energy eigen-value defferential equation.
The energy eigen-states for the simple harmonic oscillator form a discrete set.
Thus, the oscillator is only allowed to have discrete energies.
One of the properties of these eigen-states is that their combinations are
also solutions to the Schrodinger equation.
This means that an oscillator may be in a state of superposition with
a choice of several energy eigen-values.

No single energy eigen-state of a simple harmonic oscillator describes the motion of the particle,
even though the particle's energy is known with certitude.
The particle's position and momentum is left so uncertain that
one is just as likely to find the particle at a certain point at a given time as
one is to find it at that point at any other time(P[r,t₀]=P[r,t] for all t₀ and t).
This is because energy eigen-states behave like static waves, oscillating about a fixed space.
For this reason, a single energy eigen-state is said to be static.

In order to describe the motion of a particle,
one must be able to correspond the particle's position with time.
This entails localizing the particle, and following it as time progresses.
One can localize the particle by superimposing several energy eigen-states.
Like waves of different wavelength, these states destructivel interfere at some points, and
constructively interfere at others.
These inteference evolve with time,
changing one's knowlege of the most likely position of the particle.
Thus, some knowledge of the particle's motion is gained.
But if one constructs an energy state out of several energy eigen-states, then
this construct assigns to the oscillator several different possibilities fo its energy.
Therefore, by localizing the particle's position through the superposition of energy eigen-states,
one loses knowledge of the particle's energy.

The correspondence principle states that the Quantum theory
must approach the classical view at the large scale limit.
This means that at the macroscopic scale the particle
is seen to have a precise position, momentum, and energy.
In this paper I minimize the uncertainties of the simple harmonic oscillator.
I show that with the proper distribution of energy eigen-states
centered about a given average energy,
I can have all relative uncertainties vanish at the large scale limtit, as
guaranteed by the correspondence principle.

I think my test of Quantum Mechanics is interesting.
Although Quantum Mechanics is a well stablished theory, as a student
I find its philosophical implications bewildering and
want reassurance that the correspondense principle really holds.
In my test the method I used to minimize uncertainties
is from the relatively new field of mathematical programming.
Mathematicla programming developed during World War II to
find efficient allocations of scarce resources--that is,
trying to get the most out of the constrained amount[²](REFERENCE.md).
Finally, my test illustrates how one can construct a state in order to
either minimize or maximize some property of that state.
